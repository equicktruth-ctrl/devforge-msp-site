    <h1>How I Built My Portfolio</h1>

    <h3>Step 1: Clarifying the purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Before writing a single line of code, I defined what this portfolio needed to do: clearly present my operations
      leadership and IT experience, highlight certifications and technical skills, and make it effortless for
      recruiters to contact me or download my resume. Having that focus early on kept every design decision intentional
      instead of random.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Choosing tools and workflow</h3>
    <p>
      I built the site with a straightforward stack: HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, edited in Visual Studio Code.
      Git handled version control, GitHub hosted the code, and GitHub Pages now serves the live site. This setup keeps
      costs low, performance high, and deployments as simple as <code>git push</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Structuring pages and assets</h3>
    <p>
      A clean structure makes updates much easier. I created separate pages for the homepage, projects, skills,
      experience, and blog, with shared navigation across all of them. Images and documents, like my resume and profile
      pictures, live in an <code>assets/</code> folder so paths stay consistent and easy to manage.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Designing the homepage hero</h3>
    <p>
      The hero section introduces who I am in a single glance: name, headline, contact info, and clear calls to action
      such as “Download Resume” and “Contact Me.” A gradient header, centered layout, and profile image help the page
      feel modern without relying on heavy frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Breaking content into focused pages</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of cramming everything onto one long page, I split content into logical sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experience:</strong> a dedicated page for my professional history with clear bullet points.</li>
      <li><strong>Skills & Certifications:</strong> a separate skills page that groups technologies, tools, and
        certifications in a visual grid.</li>
      <li><strong>Projects:</strong> a projects page that combines a hand-written case study with live data from my
        GitHub repositories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This layout makes it easier for recruiters to jump straight to what they care about most.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6: Building the projects page with GitHub data</h3>
    <p>
      The projects page does two things: it features this case study at the top and then loads my repositories from
      GitHub using their public API. Cards show the project name, description, language, and a quick link to view the
      repo. Sorting options, like “Recently Updated,” help surface the most relevant work.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 7: Contact options that fit how people actually reach out</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of a heavy backend, I kept contact simple and flexible. Visitors can email me directly with a mailto
      link, fill out a small form that opens their email client with details pre-filled, or message me on LinkedIn.
      This approach keeps my API keys and infrastructure minimal while still giving recruiters multiple ways to connect.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 8: The “Ask Me Anything” experiment</h3>
    <p>
      On the Netlify deployment of this site, I added an experimental “Ask Me Anything” widget powered by a serverless
      function and the Perplexity API. The function sits behind the scenes, safely handling the API key and returning
      answers. Because GitHub Pages is purely static hosting and doesn’t support serverless functions, that feature is
      intentionally disabled on the GitHub Pages version to avoid exposing sensitive keys.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 9: Adding light/dark mode with a dynamic logo</h3>
    <p>
      To make the site more comfortable to use, especially in low-light environments, I added a light/dark mode toggle.
      When you click it, the background, text colors, and even the logo switch to match the selected theme. A small
      JavaScript snippet handles the toggle and saves the preference in <code>localStorage</code>, so the site remembers
      your choice next time you visit.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 10: Iterating, debugging, and polishing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Testing navigation across all pages to make sure every link feels natural and consistent.</li>
      <li>Checking image and asset paths after each structural change to avoid broken links.</li>
      <li>Using Git commits as checkpoints so any major change can be rolled back safely.</li>
      <li>Refining wording and layout over time as the site evolves and my experience grows.</li>
    </ul><h3>Why the "Ask Me Anything" feature is experimental</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On the Netlify deployment of this site, I added an experimental “Ask Me Anything” widget powered by a serverless
        function and the Perplexity API. The function runs in the background, safely handling the API key and returning answers.
      </li>
      <li>
        GitHub Pages only serves static files and doesn’t support serverless functions, so this widget isn’t active on the
        GitHub Pages version of my portfolio.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This portfolio isn’t a one-time project—it’s a living representation of my skills. As I learn new tools, ship new
      projects, and earn new certifications, the site evolves with me.
