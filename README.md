# DevForge MSP Site

Marketing and services website for DevForge IT, a small MSP-style brand showcasing remote-friendly IT support, cloud management, and cybersecurity services.

## Project Overview

This site is a multi-page static portfolio built to look and feel like a real managed service provider website. It highlights service offerings, experience, client stories, and visual branding suitable for recruiters and small business owners evaluating IT partners.

## Features

- Multi-page layout (Home, Services, Experience, Projects, Client Stories)
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- Services cards for IT support, cloud, and cybersecurity
- Project tiles that link out to live demos and GitHub repositories

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 and CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (for navigation, theming, and small UX enhancements)
- Git and GitHub for version control and hosting

## Getting Started

- Open the repository in GitHub and download it as a ZIP, or clone it using your preferred Git client.
- Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Use a simple extension like Live Server or open `index.html` directly in the browser to preview.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be hosted as a static site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static web host. Point the host to the project root so `index.html` is served as the main entry point.
